# ChatBot Service

## Getting started
In the project directory, you can run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
This starts the API server in debug mode at localhost:3434


To run client side content, you can run:
```
cd client
npm start
```

This starts the React app server at localhost:3000 and proxies the remote calls to localhost:3434
